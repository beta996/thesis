<h1> Web application for Automated Supervised Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis. </h1>

> **Sentiment analysis** (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral.

1. First, the user can upload ready dataset(s) and/or load their own and do some preprocessing on the data:

2. In the next steps Exploratory Data Analysis can be done, followed by Feature Extraction (Bag-Of-Words or TF-IDF).

3. Then, the user is obliged to do the feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset (and to view the most relevent words indicating the sentiment). In the next step, cross validation is conducted (so basically training several models using chosen supervised ML algorithms on a chosen range of parameters) - this is to maximise the final accuracy by choosing best performing hyperparams.

4. At last, the user can display historical runs, together with their perfomance scores and other parameters.
